Hi {firstname} {lastname},

Thank you for your order on {shop_name}!

When you placed the order, one or some of your products where announced with a shipping time, which means that they are currently not available.
Please find below the concerned product(s):

{missing_products_txt}

Given that the shipping time announced on our website may vary by a few days, we took the initiative of splitting
your order into two separate ones, so that we can send you in a first parcel all the products that are currently in stock.
Please find in the attached document the list of the products that will be shipped in the first parcel.
As for the product(s) that are not available at the moment, they will be sent out later once they will be back in stock.

You will receive an email with the tracking of the shipment as soon as each parcel will be ready to leave our warehouse.
Kindest regards.
